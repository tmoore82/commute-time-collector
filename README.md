# Description

commute-time-collector is a set of two Perl scripts that takes a given latitude and longitude, generates pairs of latitudes and longitudes at regular distance and bearing intervals from the given lat, lng pair, then sets up a cron job to ping the Google Maps API at regular intervals specified by the user to pull commute times between the input point and the generated points. 

This was developed as a way to figure out which areas in a town have the shortest commute times to a workplace.

Note that use of the results generated by commute-time-collector are subject to the Google Maps API [Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/maps/terms). 

# Prep and Run

1. Back up crontab

2. Edit crontab and make sure it has the following line:

   ```PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin```
   
3. place commute-time-collector.pl in /usr/local/bin and make sure it is executable

4. place api-request.pl in /usr/local/bin and make sure it is executable

5. Make directory /usr/local/var/commute-time-collector

6. Call 
   
   `perl /usr/local/var/commute-time-collector.pl \[latitude\] \[longitude\] \[distance interval (mi)\] \[max distance (mi)\] \[time interval (min)\] \[google maps api key\] \[start time (24 hr)\] \[end time (24 hr)\]`

	- `latitude`: latitude of your desired destination in degrees
	- `longitude`: longitude of your desired destination in degrees
	- `distance interval (mi)`: how far out to make each new set of routes (how frequently do you want the program to draw circles around the destination--cannot be less than 5 or greater than 30)
	- `max distance (mi)`: max number of miles from desired destination. right now, cannot be greater than 30 and must be greater than or equal to the distance interval
	- time interval (min): how often to check for data in minutes 
	- `google maps api key`: if you don't have a Google Maps API key, you can get one [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
	- `start time`: the hour, out of 24, that you want to start each day (i.e., 6, 12, 15) -- should be hour only and not include minutes
	- `end time`: the hour, out of 24, that you want to end each day (i.e., 9, 16, 22) -- should be hour only and not include minutes

This will create a file in `/usr/local/var/commute-time-collector` with a header containing the information you entered plus a number of "routes" with lat,lng pairs for origins and destinations generated from your input.

The script will then add a job to crontab to run at the interval specified by the user to collect results that will be placed in a results file in `/usr/local/var/commute-time-collector`. Currently there is no option to designate specific days. The program will run daily and indefinitely until the entry is edited or deleted from crontab.

The `-results` file will contain semi-colon delimited values that you can import into your data analyzing program of choice.

# Troubleshooting

Crontab should contain at least one line referencing api-request.pl after you've successfully run commute-time-collector.pl. 

api-request.pl does the actual work of getting the commute times from Google Maps and translating those into legible results. If this isn't running, you'll get no results.

# TODO 

 - [ ] Update project with examples of what crontab output should look like
 - [ ] Update project with examples of what commute-time-collector.pl output should look like
 - [ ] Update project with examples of what api-request.pl output should look like
